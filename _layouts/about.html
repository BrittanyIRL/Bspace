  	<p>Brittany is a web developer who really prefers the front end because she wants to remain human. She likes working with everything javascript and css. In her other time, she takes photos for the independent Seattle radio station KEXP, and splits reading time between campy near-future science fiction and memoirs by funny ladies. She has all too frequent dreams about velociraptors due to seeing Jurassic Park too young. Her favorite Nicholas Cage movie is Valley Girl.</p>

  	<p>Hi! I'm Brittany, I'm a front end web developer with a big imagination and major determination. Yes I love technology, but not as much as real life you see - I love to go outside and explore and see live music and cook and a billion other things. I love classic science fiction and the fast and furious franchise. My favorite Nicholas Cage movie is Valley Girl. Velociraptors are often chasing me in my dreams because I watched Jurassic Park when I was very small (and I love it). I am a feminist and a #nastywoman.</p>

I realized last week that it's been a full year since I started at BPT. This time last June I was 6 months graduated from General Assembly's Web
Development Immersive bootcamp, and had just come from a stint at a creative
agency where a very well meaning senior dev told me I really needed to get
better at javascript before "anyone would consider hiring me" and before that the most anxiety filled 2 weeks of my life at a startup.
I couldn't have asked for a better place to end up as a junior front end dev (I've since been promoted/dropped the junior). I'm glad that my managers took a chance of a fresh face. The last year I've had at BPT has been so great. Literally every day I'm thankful I get to do what I love (even the stressful days where nothing works). I work with an incredibly smart team of people and have learned from all of them over the last year.

Of those, these are the top few things I've learned/relearned over the past year about being a developer.

1. Admit to your mistakes. Do not blame others.
2. Fix your mistakes. If you did something wrong, you should spend the time making it right.
3. Ask so many questions.
4. Never forget why you chose to be a developer.
5. There's something to be learned from everyone on the team regardless of seniority or age.
6. There's also something major to be said for just shutting up and listening.
7. When you're frustrated by an issue it's often best to just get up and walk away for 10 minutes before trying to hack a fix.
8. Don't ever npm install anything without checking what it does first.
9. Always keep learning.
10. Optimism, honesty and being humble go a long way.

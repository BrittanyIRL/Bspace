<p>Hi there! I’m “you’re average twenty-something” going after what they love. yadda yadda yadda. Only difference here is that I intend on actually doing it (I am doing it). I’m trying something new here and combining all of my pieces of the internet into one so this should give a more complete picture of me. We’ll call this my little corner of the internet.</p>

<p>I’m a web developer. All things code excite me. I am a nerd to the core. But I can talk your ear off about different types and shades of lipstick, what the best Friday the 13th movie really is (it’s the 3rd one), or make you one mean german chocolate cake. All of that to try and summarize – I am who I am who I am and I don’t intend on giving up what I love just because I also need to make a living (go figure!).</p>

<p>I have a love of taking photos at concerts. I have the privilege of shooting a multitude of events around Seattle – I feel very lucky. I dabble in freelance photography – with the occasional commercial work. I also take on-location portraits. I enjoy more candid environments and settings, you will never find me posing a person in front of a backdrop, it’s just not my style. I value capturing human emotion in frames.</p>

<p>Other things about me…  I am always making puns under my breath to myself.  I like to run, but my knees hate it – we’re finding a balance we can both live with. I could never have too many shades of lipstick or nail polish – those are my two favorite accessories.  Also, I really love dinosaurs. My writing is very scattered (so are my thoughts). I like the term “Strident Feminist” – I am one.</p>

<p>Thanks for spending the time reading this, I value that you are spending your time reading my words – that will always blow me away. Feel free to chime in on anything I pen, conversation is something I can never have enough of.</p>
